# 20-Abgabe01-Suekar-Heiling A repository to manage Konfig Assignment.  

## Description:        
This is a Project focused about different Drinks. The base structure consists of the 3 Java classes `Drink`, `Liquid` and `SimpleDrink` which is extended from `Drink`. From the Testing side of things there is already the `LiquidTest` class given. 
The purpose of this Project is to practice the handling with git, writing useful JavaDoc and testing with JUnit5.
## Planned Extension: 
     Mead.java extends the class SimpleDrink.java. It will use a Collection to vary the 
     flavours. For example if you mix mead with water it will have a health promoting
     effect. The class will contain a method that can check if the mead is health promoting
     if its not an exception will be thrown. (OnlySpritzwineIsHealthyException).
