# 20-Abgabe01-Suekar-Heiling A repository to manage Konfig Assignment.  

## Description:        
This is a Project focused about different Drinks. The base structure consists of the 3 Java classes `Drink.java`, `Liquid.java` and `SimpleDrink.java` which is extended from `Drink.java`. From the Testing side of things there is already the `LiquidTest.java` class given. 
The purpose of this Project is to practice the handling with git, writing useful JavaDoc and testing with JUnit5.
## Planned Extension: 
`Mead.java` extends the class `SimpleDrink.java`. It will use a Collection to vary the flavours.
For example if you mix mead with water it will have a health promoting
effect. The class will contain a method `drink()`. This methods let you drink the Drink,
until it's empty. In case there is nothing left to drink it will throw an execption.
(`BringTheSpritzwineException`).
